Here's the plan. We'll have a database storing these tables:

student(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name text, profile text, img_url text);
professor(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name text, profile text, img_url text);
course(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name text, professor_id integer REFERENCES professor(id));
registration(student_id integer REFERENCES student(id), course_id integer REFERENCES course(id));

Then, we'll build a UI for the information, based on the following features:

Students can log in and:
    - Update their profile.
    - Change their profile picture.
    - Register for courses (only those that professors have already created).
    - See the names of other students in each of their courses.

Professors can log in and:
    - Update their profile.
    - Change their profile picture.
    - Register courses they will be teaching.
    - See the names of students in each of the courses their teaching.

Bonus:
    - If we have time after that stuff, we would like professors to be able to
      play a flash card name game with the pictures of students in each of their
      classes.
