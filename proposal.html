
<h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
<h2>We plan to work on all of the steps below while applying the best programming practices as well as using good styalistic guidelines.</h2>

<h3>Students can log in and:</h3>
<ul>
    <li> Update their profile.</li>
    <li> Change their profile picture.</li>
    <li> Register for courses (only those that professors have already created).</li>
    <li> See the names of other students in each of their courses.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Professors can log in and:</h3>
<ul>
    <li> Update their profile.</li>
    <li> Change their profile picture.</li>
    <li> Register courses they will be teaching.</li>
    <li> See the names of students in each of the courses their teaching.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Database Layout</h3>
<ul>
    <li>student(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name text, profile text, img_url text);</li>
    <li>professor(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name text, profile text, img_url text);</li>
    <li>course(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name text, professor_id integer REFERENCES professor(id));</li>
    <li>registration(student_id integer REFERENCES student(id), course_id integer REFERENCES course(id));</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bonus:</h3>
<ul>
    <li> If we have time after that stuff, we would like professors to be able to play a flash card name game with the pictures of students in each of their classes.</li>
    <li> We would also potentially like to attempt authentication</li>
    <li> Another stretch goal is to add score visualization for the flashcard games</li>
  </ul>
